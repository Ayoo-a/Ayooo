    <h1>Me Dearest</h1>
    <div class="she">
        <p>Happy Birthday to the most incredible woman I’ve ever known. There aren’t enough words to capture just how rare and precious you are, but I’m going to try because today—your day—deserves nothing less.</p>
        <p>First, thank you for being the beautiful, kind, and pure soul that you are. To call you a rare gem doesn’t even come close. You’re the treasure people search lifetimes for, the blessing I’m beyond lucky to have in my life. Having you by my side means more to me than any success, any accomplishment—you are the real gift, the only one that makes my life complete.</p>
        <p>Today’s not just any day; it’s a celebration of everything wonderful in this world, wrapped up in one perfect human being—you. Knowing you, laughing with you, and loving you has brought so much light into my life. Every day feels brighter just by having you in it, and I honestly can’t imagine a world without you.</p>
        <p>I miss you every moment we're apart, and my heart is always counting down the seconds until I’m with you again. Every time I have to say goodbye, a part of me feels incomplete until I’m back in your arms. There’s no work, no duty, no responsibility that could ever take your place in my life. You’re the one my heart belongs to, and that’s where it will stay, forever.</p>
        <p>You are beautiful—no, beyond beautiful. You’re gorgeous, captivating, and more than even a queen deserves to be called. You’re brilliant, intelligent, strong, and so resilient. Your beauty is matched only by your mind and your heart, and I feel honored to be the one you share it all with. I’ve waited for this day not just to celebrate you, but to remind you how deeply loved you are and how much you mean to me, today and every single day.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being you, for choosing me, for loving me as I am, and for giving me the chance to love you in return. You’re more to me than words could ever explain, and I’m endlessly grateful for you, my love. Here’s to you, the queen of my heart, and to a day as amazing as you are.</p>
        <p class="her">Feliz cumpleaños mi amor. Te amo ahora y siempre.</p>
