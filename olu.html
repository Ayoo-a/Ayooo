    <p class="only">Yeah so, Today, I’m writing in CODE's, because ordinary words just can’t handle the upgrade that you are!</p>
    <div class="she">
        <p>Me Queen, Oluwamayomikun Ayomide Adeleke, the < header> of my life—because nothing starts right without you. If you were HTML, you’d be < DOCTYPE Legendary>  and my entire code would collapse without your epic < body> holding it together.</p>
        <p>Forget Flexbox or Grid; nothing aligns me better than you do. I mean, what’s "display:inline-block" next to how we roll? You’re like the "z-index: 1000" that stands out no matter what, and don’t get me started on your "background-color" it’s my favorite shade of perfection.</p>
        <p>Honestly, if CSS had a wife-material attribute, you’d be the default value. You’re the only function in my codebase that I don’t want to run on autopilot because, girlll, I want to be there, console.log()-ing every second!</p>
        <p>And don't think I forgot that first day we met, You were like an "onclick" event in my life, and my heart’s been "addEventListener("smitten", you)" ever since. I was just a clueless variable until you declared me worthy of your scope, and now I’m a global variable because of you, babe!</p>
        <p>Let’s be real, you’re the only argument I’d return forever, without any conditions or loops to break out of. With you, my happiness stays in an endless for loop, and you know I’m ready to handle any exceptions, especially since you are the exception to every other girl on Earth.</p>
        <p>So here’s to you, the ultimate line of code in my life. Let’s keep rewriting history, styling our love, and debugging our way through everything that comes our way. Because, with you, my code is always error-free—and way, way more fun.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="onlyh">Happy Birthday, Oluwamayomikun! I love you more than an infinite loop loves running.</h2>
